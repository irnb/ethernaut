# FlipCoin

I've created a smart contract called FlipCoinWinner that calculates if the CoinFlip will be heads or tails.

Steps to reproduce :

- Set up the FlipCoin contract address
- Deploy the smart contract on the same network as the FlipCoin contract (because it needs block number)
- Call the `flip` function 10 times (wait a block validation between each call)

You can use the [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) to develop and deploy smart contracts, and interact with them (e.g. send transactions).
You can use [Metamask](https://metamask.io) to sign transactions in your browser, or use Ethereum Wallets (e.g [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com))
